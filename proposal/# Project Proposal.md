### Introduction

Image colorization is an essential image processing and computer vision branch to colorize images and videos. Recently, deep learning techniques progressed notably for image colorization. Given a gray photograph as input, hallucinating its color version is an ill-posed problem. First, gray images have much less information than colorful images, where each pixel value in the image is divided into three primary color components of R, G, and B, and each primary color component directly determines the intensity of its base color. However, A gray digital image is an image with only one sampled color per pixel. How to color the images and let them pass the color turing test is a big problem to solve. At the same time, the early AI was not perfect for the recognition of the shape of the picture, the adjacent grayscale of the edge of object’s contour could not accurately distinguish the recognition, and the color was more inclined to the low saturation color that was not vivid. What’s more, the training data done with color image decolorization will also have some impact, and the color information of the color photo to remove the RGB channel is not the real black and white camera original film, and there will be a big difference in the performance of grayscale.

And Here are some papers that we are going to learn:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): [1406.2661.pdf (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)

### Dataset
As image data required to train our own model, we will download datasets from the Internet. 

- The link of the first one is: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shravankumar9892/image-colorization/data".
- It consists of around 25k images, gray scale images are taken as input and a and b components of LAB color space are taken as output.

 We are looking for other datasets, and a total of 100k images are expected.

### Implement and Potential Problem

We want to build a model based on Generatvie Adversarial Networks, and we will use CNNs to be the Generator and the Discriminator. Although we haven't come up with the structure of our model, we are now looking for the state-of-art design of the GAN.

Manual coloring and AI coloring are the same, it is impossible to accurately distinguish the same grayscale picture in the black and white photo out of two different colors, there is no basis for forced differentiation to determine the color is inaccurate, so the real recovery of black and white photo color is a pseudo-proposition, can only make a relatively accurate color.

### Success Criteria
The objective of this work is to train a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and with the color palette provided, it is able to recolor the target images. The following picture is the result expected:

Perceptual Realism: The ultimate purpose of our colorization is to make the picture look real and believable, in order to measure the degree of authenticity of the image, we ran a real vs fake two-alternative forced choice experiment on our friends and family members. We first choose some
photos and decolorized them into grayscale pictures, then we use the model to generate a series of new colorful pictures by doing automatic colorization. Participants in the experiment were shown a series of pairs of images. Each pair contains an original color photo next to a re-colorized
version, produced by our algorithm. Participants were asked to choose the photo they believed contained fake colors generated by our program.
