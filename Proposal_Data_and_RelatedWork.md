## Data
As image data required to train our own model, we will download datasets from the Internet. The link of the first one is: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shravankumar9892/image-colorization/data". It consists of around 25k images. We are looking for other datasets, and a total of 100k images are expected.
